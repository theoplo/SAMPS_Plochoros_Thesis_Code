The steps required to run the code are largely self-explanatory. Nevertheless, to eliminate any potential ambiguity, a few key points regarding the user’s input commands are clarified below.

1) r-mode selection

The parameter r corresponds to the radial position within the plasma, ranging from the magnetic axis (r = 0) to the plasma edge (r = a). To obtain solutions of the wave–electron resonance condition across this interval, the user should select option “S”, which performs a full radial scan.

If instead the radius is to be held fixed—allowing the user to examine the solution profile at a specific location—any option other than “S” may be used.
Specifically, option “A” fixes the radius at the plasma edge, while option “F” allows the user to specify a custom value.

Options “B”, “C”, and “Q” correspond to predefined q-surfaces (magnetic islands). In these cases, the appropriate value of r is computed automatically so that it satisfies the selected condition.


2) Density-profile selection

The user may choose among three electron-density profiles:

- parabolic (L-mode plasma),

- exponential (H-mode plasma),

- pedestal-type (H-mode plasma).

Within the context of this thesis, the exponential profile was omitted entirely. A comparison between the parabolic and pedestal profiles was considered sufficient, as they constitute the simplest and most representative cases.


3) CSV filename

Finally, the user may optionally specify the name of the CSV output file in advance—ideally using a name consistent with the selected options in steps 1 and 2—to avoid accidental overwriting and potential data loss.
